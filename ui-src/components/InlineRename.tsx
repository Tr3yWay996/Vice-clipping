 * and on a highlight row, and renaming from the viewer and the trim window
 * would have made four. The differences that mattered are the two props below;
 * everything else about them was already the same.
 *
 * Blur commits, because the surfaces this appears on close on an outside
 * click and an edit that vanished on the way out reads as data loss. The
 * `done` guard is what stops the blur that follows Enter from submitting a
 * second time.
